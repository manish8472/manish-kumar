// This file serves as a central export point for all components in the library.
// This allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.
// For example, instead of:
// import Button from './components/button/Button';
// import Heading from './components/heading/Heading';
// You can do:
// import { Button, Heading } from './components';

export { default as Button } from "./button/Button";
export { default as Heading } from "./heading/Heading";
export { default as InputField } from "./inputfield/InputField";
export { default as Logo } from "./logo/Logo";
export { default as Text } from "./text/Text";
export { default as Ticket } from "./ticket/Ticket";
export { default as PageLayout } from "./page_layout/Page_Layout";
